Our group decided to create a staff management system. (5)

We notice that current companies may have difficulties in tracking and collecting records of clocking in and out. Traditional clock-in cards are often being used, which brings some drawbacks, such as loss and discrepancies of information, time-wasting and creating errors when working hours of employees calculated manually. Therefore, our rationale for building the system is to help company to manage and college records of employees conveniently and systematically. Company can also review and input performance of employees with the help of system.


We would like to add the following functions in the system:
1.  Determine whether employees are late or on time. 

2.	Make a monthly record of attendance.  Show a list of employees with perfect attendance.

3.  Make a monthly record of late arrival or early leave.

4.  Employees who have been absent for more than 3 times, $500 of salary would be deducted.	

5.  Set a monthly target.  Sort employees based on their targets achieved. Show that which employees reach the target and  those who donâ€™t.

6.  Create a new employee record by adding the employee's ID, name, age, role and salary during program running time.

7.  Search for an employee by inputting their ID, name, age, role.

8.  Edit or delete a the record of a current employee.

9.  Export the monthly record to an external file.

10. Sort for an employee by ID, age, salary, revenue, attendance, late arrivals, early leave.

11. Load an external file.


Coding style of our system:

Sorting, File I/O, Class function, Calculation and For loop would be used in our project.
Dynamic mangement will be utilized. In-code documentation  and other coding documents mentioned in the project description will also be added.

It is hoped that the management system could be more use-friendly after our correction.
